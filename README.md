# strapi-template-to-customize

👉 This repo is to be used as boilerplate code for the strapi **template** portion of creating and customizing a [strapi starter](https://strapi.io/blog/announcing-the-strapi-starter-cli) for your dev team.

This repo is referenced by the customizeable, strapi starter [`strapi-starter-to-customize`](https://github.com/strapi-training/strapi-starter-to-customize), in its [`starter.json`](https://github.com/strapi-training/strapi-starter-to-customize/blob/master/starter.json#L2) file.  As such, this repo represents the required strapi **template**, that will provide the backend, strapi API for our customized, strapi starter, detailed in this repo's [instructional video](ℹ️  There is a companion, strapi training, [video series](https://twitter.com/monico_moreno/status/1386834033179602946) with which this repo corresponds.).

(Please see benefits of strapi starters in [this video series](https://strapi.training/videos/intro-to-auxiliary-benefits-to-strapi-starters), which goes over auxiliary benefits like: R&D, prototyping, and proofs of concept.)

# Misc Notes
* Credit: The code in this repo's `template` folder was generated with the general, [create-strapi-app](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/tree/master/packages/create-strapi-app) CLI.

* This repo is a [strapi template](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/templates.html), **in and of itself**, that you can actually use it as such on the command line, to generate a bare-bones, strapi app like this 👇

```
yarn create strapi-app my-strapi-app-folder-name --template strapi-training/to-customize
```
